# Visavis

Basic chat app in Elixir based on Logan Bresnahan's blog post Elixir WebSocket Chat Example w/o Phoenix.


## Install & Run
Fetch and compile dependencies:
 `mix deps.get`
 `mix deps.compile`

Start the development server:
`iex -S mix`

Visit `http://localhost:4000/`, ideally in two different browers.  Type a message in the input field and hit the "send" button in one window.  The message should show up in the other window, and vice versa.
